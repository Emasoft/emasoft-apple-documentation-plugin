"""Unified publish pipeline: bypass-guard -> lint -> validate (remote CPV) -> test -> bump -> badge -> changelog -> commit -> push -> release.

Node/TypeScript variant of the CPV canonical publish.py (the canon is generated
for Python plugins by generate_plugin_repo.py; this copy swaps the Python-only
parts). Lint is eslint + tsc (ruff on this script; mypy is gate G2d), tests are jest, and
the version lives in .claude-plugin/plugin.json, package.json AND pyproject.toml,
bumped together (CPV compares them; uv.lock is re-synced). Node tooling runs through
pnpm, whose exact version is pinned in
package.json "packageManager". There is deliberately no npm publish: the plugin
is distributed through the Emasoft/emasoft-plugins marketplace.

Modes:
  --gate                  Quality gate, no bump/push. Runs, in order: eslint +
                          tsc + ruff (G2), jscpd (G2b), actionlint (G2c), mypy
                          (G2d), the compiled build gates (G2e), shellcheck
                          (G2f), the remote CPV validate (G3), the trufflehog
                          secret scan (G3s), the jest suite (G4) and the Linux
                          fork-parity probe (G4b, a no-op for this plugin).
                          Runs STANDALONE for a local pre-release check. When
                          invoked by the pre-push hook it ALSO enforces that the
                          push was started by this script (G0) and that the
                          version was bumped (G1) — those two protect a push, so
                          they only apply while one is in flight (issue cpv#192).
  --print-gates           Print the numbered pipeline stage list and exit 0.
                          Pure information: no side effects, no repo lookup.
  --install-hook          Install git-hooks/pre-push into .git/hooks/ and set core.hooksPath.
  --install-branch-rules  Apply the cpv-branch-rules GitHub ruleset to the origin
                          (server-side CI enforcement — run once after first push).
  (no flag)               Full release pipeline (15 stages, fail-fast). The bump type
                          is AUTO-DETECTED via `git-cliff --bumped-version` from the
                          conventional commits on HEAD.
  --patch/--minor/--major Force a specific bump type (overrides auto-detection).

Pipeline stages (all fail-fast — any non-zero exit aborts). The list below,
`_PIPELINE_STAGES`, the `[N/M]` progress labels and `--print-gates` are ONE
source of truth — the count is derived, never retyped (audit row 31):
   1. Bypass guard — reject CPV_SKIP_*, SKIP_*, NO_VERIFY env vars
   2. Check working tree is clean
   3. Lint + type-check (eslint + tsc, ruff on scripts/)
   4. Run tests (jest via pnpm test)
   5. Validate plugin (uvx cpv-remote-validate plugin . --strict — fetches
      the canonical CPV validator from GitHub so this plugin never vendors
      a local copy and never drifts from upstream rules)
   6. Secret scan (trufflehog). A pipeline stage as well as a gate stage: a
      plugin whose hooks were never installed would otherwise publish having
      scanned nothing.
   7. Linux fork-parity probe (a no-op here: it only applies to Python process pools)
   8. CI-parity preflight (uvx cpv-remote-validate ci-preflight . — the
      jscpd / actionlint / mypy / Mega-Linter / static-CIP gates that CI's
      Lint job runs but `validate_plugin --strict` does NOT). Runs BEFORE the
      bump/commit/tag/push, so a pipeline defect can never leave a
      half-published state. A MISSING local tool degrades to a WARNING and never
      blocks the publish.
   9. Marketplace-registration check (Layout A: notify workflow + PAT secret +
      remote marketplace.json registration + remote receiver workflow;
      Layout B: must run from marketplace root + nested plugin must be listed)
  10. Check version consistency across all sources (plugin.json, package.json, pyproject.toml)
  11. Bump version in plugin.json, package.json and pyproject.toml (then re-sync uv.lock)
  12. Update README version badge
  13. Generate changelog (git-cliff)
  14. Commit, tag, push
  15. Create GitHub release (gh CLI)

Post-release stages (deliberately UNNUMBERED — they run after the release is
public and can never abort it): verify CI is green, prove the release installs.

Gate stages (--gate mode, called by pre-push hook):
   G0. Orchestrator check — direct `git push` is blocked; only publish.py
       may initiate a push (verified via process ancestry, NOT env vars).
   G1. Version bump check (local vs remote, auto-detects origin/HEAD)
   G2. Lint (pnpm install --frozen-lockfile, eslint, tsc, ruff on scripts/)
   G2b. Copy-paste check (jscpd, parity with ci.yml Mega-Linter COPYPASTE_JSCPD;
        WARNs+skips if jscpd/npx unavailable so a push is never false-blocked)
   G2c. Workflow lint (actionlint, parity with ci.yml Lint job; WARNs+skips if
        actionlint unavailable so a push is never false-blocked)
   G2d. Type-check (mypy scripts/ --ignore-missing-imports, parity with ci.yml
        Mega-Linter PYTHON_MYPY; WARNs+skips if mypy unavailable so a push is
        never false-blocked)
   G2e. Compiled-component build gates (cargo clippy+test / go vet+build+test /
        dotnet build / swift build / zig build), each self-detecting; WARNs+skips
        if the toolchain is unavailable so a push is never false-blocked. C/C++ is
        detected + noted (built in CI; no false-block-safe local command) (issue #175)
   G2f. Shell lint (shellcheck, parity with ci.yml Mega-Linter BASH_SHELLCHECK;
        WARNs+skips if shellcheck unavailable so a push is never false-blocked)
   G3. Validate (uvx cpv-remote-validate plugin . --strict)
   G3s. Secret scan (trufflehog; installed on demand — a FAILED install blocks,
        because "we never looked" is not "we looked and found nothing")
   G4. Tests (pnpm test, i.e. jest; includes the bundle-freshness and standalone-
       bundle tests, so a stale committed bundle blocks the push)
   G4b. Linux fork-parity probe — no-op for this plugin (Python process pools only)

Usage:
    uv run python scripts/publish.py                      # auto-bump from git-cliff
    uv run python scripts/publish.py --gate
    uv run python scripts/publish.py --install-hook
    uv run python scripts/publish.py --install-branch-rules
    uv run python scripts/publish.py --patch              # force patch
    uv run python scripts/publish.py --minor              # force minor
    uv run python scripts/publish.py --major              # force major
    uv run python scripts/publish.py --dry-run            # preview (auto-bump)

Cornerstone rule: a plugin CANNOT be pushed unless validation passes with
0 issues (WARNING allowed). There are no exceptions and no bypass flags.
Every push is blocked unless scripts/publish.py orchestrates it end-to-end
AND stage_validate / stage_tests / stage_lint all succeed.

    """Step 1: Reject any env var that could bypass a check. No exceptions.

    Issue #22 hardening (v2.86.0): broadened from a fixed allowlist to
    prefix-pattern matching. Any env var matching ``PLUGIN_SKIP_*``,
    ``CPV_SKIP_*``, ``SKIP_*``, or named ``NO_VERIFY`` aborts the publish.
    Closes the loophole where a fresh skip name (e.g. ``CPV_SKIP_GATE7``)
    that was not in the original explicit list would silently slip past.

    Explicit infrastructure exemptions remain — all are read-only
    overrides used by CPV's own integrity / auth subsystems and never
    skip a gate:
        * ``PLUGIN_SKIP_GITHUB_INTEGRITY=1`` — bypasses the GitHub-anchored
          integrity check (see the hash-verify module). That check is a
          defence against tampering, NOT a publish gate.
        * ``CPV_SKIP_GITHUB_INTEGRITY=1`` — the LEGACY spelling of the same
          override, still honoured (deprecated, TRDD-bbff5bc5).
        * ``CPV_SKIP_GH_AUTH_CHECK=1`` — used by `_ensure_gh_auth` to bypass
          the `gh auth status` round-trip on flaky networks. Auth still
          has to work for the actual `git push` / `gh release create`;
          this only skips the precheck.
        * ``PLUGIN_SKIP_INSTALL_SMOKE=1`` — read and documented by
          `stage_install_smoke`, which runs POST-RELEASE and can never fail the
          publish. Without this entry the documented flag aborted the run here
          instead (audit row 5), so the flag was dead code.

    The ``PLUGIN_`` spelling MUST be exempt: the hash-verify module renamed
    the var and instructs users to export it, yet ``PLUGIN_SKIP_`` is a
    forbidden PREFIX here — so without this entry, following that module's
    own deprecation notice aborts the publish as a "bypass attempt". It
    grants NO new capability (the same override is already exempt under its
    legacy name). There is deliberately no ``PLUGIN_SKIP_GH_AUTH_CHECK``
    entry — no such var exists, and exempting a name nothing reads would
    widen the bypass surface for nothing.

    there destroys every prior entry — ai-maestro#62), which means handing it to
    `gh release create --notes-file` publishes the project's ENTIRE history as
    every single release's body. That is not merely noisy: GitHub caps a release
    body at 125,000 characters, so a long-lived plugin eventually fails the
    release call AFTER its tag is already public.

    `--unreleased` belongs HERE and nowhere else — it renders only the commits
    since the previous tag — and `--strip all` drops the changelog header/footer,
    which are boilerplate inside a release body.

    The output goes to the gitignored `reports/` tree, NEVER into the repo
    proper: a file sitting in the working tree at release time is one `git add`
    away from being swept into the release commit.

    BEST-EFFORT on purpose. Any failure leaves no usable notes file and

    Consequence worth stating on purpose: CHANGELOG.md is fully DERIVED from

# generated, and is reported as-is rather than guessed.
